The black, right? \u2019Cause it should be something serious.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy was holding the dress in front of herself, then brought it down to look at it again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s too much. It\u2019ll be like I\u2019m trying too hard.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She went back to her closet and returned with a pinker, more summery top. \u201cThis is more cheerful. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be\u2026 No, that\u2019s stupid, I can\u2019t go there like this, like it\u2019s a normal day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She tossed it onto the bed. \u201cIf I had my red dress\u2026 He liked that dress. Are you sure I didn\u2019t leave it at your place?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaze had dressed in her regal purple coat, as she often did. She didn\u2019t consider putting as much thought into her appearance as Amy did. \u201cI could go back and look again.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, forget it. I\u2019ll just wear the black. Black is\u2026 it\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to wear, right?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBlack is traditionally worn in mourning, yes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amy appeared to have had the air sucked out of her by the word. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019m mourning. But\u2026 I have to be the supportive one. I mean, Tails, and\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stormed back to the closet, sweeping every piece of clothing from one side to the other. \u201cWhy? Why is it all pink? Why do I always\u2026 Why do I dress like some damsel in distress?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She turned back to Blaze. Her eyes were wet and turning pink as her wardrobe. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t be the rescuer? Why can\u2019t I save anyone?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAmy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Amy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaze suddenly took Amy\u2019s head in her hands and pulled her close. She began to breathe in a slow, steady rhythm. Amy began breathing with her, quivering. When she calmed, Blaze cupped her face in her hands and their eyes met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe can do this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know. I know we can. We can be there for\u2026 Oh, Tails, little Tails\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaze tightened her grip, as though to wring the doubt from her. \u201cWe can be strong.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah. We can.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stepped back and stood up straight, looking around her room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI wish I had the red one.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* * *<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heads turned to see the a visitor standing in the doorway of the vestibule. Though he had traded his familiar red flight jacket for a black trench coat, there was no mistaking his ovoid frame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tails had already lurched out from his pew. He struggled to stand straight as he walked toward the huge, round man, but grief and fury wracked his body with tremors. He was always the youngest of them, and now he was shaking like an old man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He stopped halfway down the aisle, lifted his head, and opened his arms as though to invite Eggman to take in the sight of the congregation, their empty faces, the altar, Knuckles standing at the lectern, the box holding his dearest friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCongratulations. This is what you\u2019ve wanted, right? Everything you\u2019ve built, everything you\u2019ve destroyed. It was all for this view, right?\u201d Tails began to stagger toward him again. \u201cYou made it. Was it\u2026 worth it?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tails\u2019 body seized, and he fell down to his knees. Vector, who was in the nearest pew, came to his side and offered a hand. Tails slapped it away and leapt up at Eggman, no longer hiding his tears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here? To gloat? You\u2019ve always hated him, and now look what you\u2019ve done, look what you\u2019ve made!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His fists pounded hollowly against Eggman\u2019s soft exterior until he didn\u2019t have the strength to hold himself up, and he slumped against the rounded doctor and whimpered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly, gently, Eggman put his arms around the small fox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once he was certain there would be no resistance, Vector pulled Tails away from Eggman and brought him back to his seat. Then Eggman sat down in the nearest pew and, along with the rest of the congregation, politely turned his attention to the lectern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>That man could deliver a better eulogy than I ever could.&nbsp;<\/em>Knuckles cleared his throat and took a moment for the air to clear.&nbsp;<em>They knew each other longer than any of us.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He would never have thought of giving the eulogy if Tails hadn\u2019t asked. He expected the departed\u2019s closest friend to speak, since Knuckles himself was making all of the other arrangements, but in the end Tails yielded this last responsibility to the taciturn echidna as well. Even after all this time, in many ways, Tails still had growing to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs some of you know, my first encounter with Sonic was on less than amicable terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 adopted the belief that he and Miles had invaded Angel Island to take away the Master Emerald, which my people held sacred. I challenged Sonic at every turn, not realizing what I was doing. I did not realize I was being deceived.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was unsurprised to see heads turning to look for any reaction from Eggman, who feigned ignorance either out of pride or courtesy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knuckles sighed and shook his head. \u201cI know what some of you are thinking, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken. There\u2019s one person to blame for what I did \u2014 and that\u2019s me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI deluded myself into thinking that the world ended with me. I didn\u2019t trust anyone from outside to let me be safe. To let me be myself. I was stronger by myself. I was stronger alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I lost everything that I realized I had nothing. I was the custodian of a floating tomb and I didn\u2019t know anyone who would call me friend.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knuckles looked over at the blown up picture resting on the easel next to the coffin: the arms rebelliously crossed, the eyes wide with expectation, looking as he did when they first met.&nbsp;<em>Is this how he will be remembered, while the rest of us get older?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered himself again. \u201cHe pointed me in the right direction and he showed me what could be accomplished if you have the courage to trust someone. As he trusted Tails. As he trusted me. And most importantly, as he trusted himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSonic was a risk taker, and he would be the first to admit that \u2014 like any of us \u2014 he\u2019d made mistakes. But that\u2019s what life is. It\u2019s mistakes. Live and learn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe never regretted a single thing he did. He learned, and he kept moving forward. He had a steadfast heart of gold. No matter what happened, no matter what anyone said, everything he did was a step in the right direction. And it\u2019s because Sonic was such a risk-taker that we\u2019re all here today.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until then that Knuckles noticed the irony in those words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He took another moment and looked out at the faces staring back at him. Amy and Blaze and Cream. Vector and them. The bird rogues he never really knew, but he was glad they were here. Shadow, Rouge. Big. Tails. He never would have known any of them if he had stayed on that island.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Sonic that we\u2019re together right now. He was open to every possibility that life could offer him and his world exploded and grew to include each and every one of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe was strong. He could fly. He reached the other side of the rainbow. But if you look around, you\u2019ll see that he\u2019s still here in each of us. In the way we live each day. Always moving forward, with no regrets.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Knuckles stepped down from the lectern, he felt lighter. Whether he had gained something or lost something, he didn\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* * *<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat was really wonderful, Knuckles.\u201d Rouge leaned in to touch him on the shoulder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shadow stopped short of the exit and draped his coat over one arm and checked his watch again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knuckles turned his attention from the Babylon Rogues to Rouge with a sense of relief that didn\u2019t escape Shadow\u2019s notice. \u201cThanks. I appreciate it. I hope he would\u2019ve liked it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe eulogy he would\u2019ve enjoyed, but the reception! I don\u2019t even see any chili dogs here.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knuckles laughed politely. \u201cI still have some things to clear up before I go. But, hey, Cream\u2019s family is having people over later, though, so\u2026 I\u2019ll meet you guys there?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh, a get-together? That\u2019s nice.\u201d Rouge looked back expectantly at Shadow, who made an exaggerated show of checking his watch. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019ll\u2026 go and change first. See you later, Knuckles.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hugged him, then turned toward Shadow, who was already walking out the door into the cool dusk. She hurried to catch up to him. \u201cSomewhere to be?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe do now, evidently.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCome on, just go with me. You don\u2019t have to say anything to anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of that today.\u201d Shadow still couldn\u2019t feign vapid optimism the way he assumed everyone else did, no matter how often he was subjected to it. Sonic had pulled him into this world and Rouge was keeping him in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He fished his keys out of his coat and unlocked the Escalade from afar. They stopped when, in its headlights, he saw the silhouette of a boy with two tails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Rouge, \u201cHello, Tails. Do you\u2026?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He looked up at her with dry, steely eyes. \u201cKnuckles is staying here. Can I\u2026 get a ride home?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shadow looked sidelong at Rouge. He had no intention of acquiescing, so he left the honor to her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOf course you can. Come on in.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they pulled out of the lot, Shadow spotted Eggman walking along the curb toward his Eggomatic hovercraft. Rouge waved politely as they passed, but it was too dark then to tell if he had noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She crossed her legs and sank back into her seat. \u201cWhat a lonely man.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they approached the intersection, Shadow turned his head to look for oncoming traffic, and in the corner of his eye he saw Tails looking out of the window back at Eggman without a hint of scorn.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a Sonic the Hedgehog fanfic written for a 1up.com contest to write the least offensive Sonic the Hedgehog fanfic.
