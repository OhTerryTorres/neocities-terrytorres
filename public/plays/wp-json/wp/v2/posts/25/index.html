It was a key component in Assassins Creed and Mirror&#8217;s Edge, and it should have stopped there. (I&#8217;ll accept inFamous, too, because at least it&#8217;s fun then.)<\/p>\n<p>But, here we are, still climbing up the sides of buildings. Like, EVERYONE can climb the sides of buildings <i>so easily.<\/i> Doesn&#8217;t that seem like a really hard thing to do? That didn&#8217;t used to be a thing. In older video games, when we came to a wall we were like, &#8220;Well, I guess we better find a way around it.&#8221; But now everyone&#8217;s trying to just climb over it.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cute idea, but you can&#8217;t put that genie back in the bottle. In the old days the question was, &#8220;If I have a grenade launcher, why can&#8217;t I explode that locked door off its hinges?&#8221; Now it&#8217;s, &#8220;If I can climb THAT wall, why can&#8217;t I climb EVERY wall??&#8221; It&#8217;s funny. As aesthetics get more realistic, the occasional inconsistencies with video game verisimilitude become more insufferable.<\/p>\n<p>But then, hey, I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised parkour is so present in a French game. A French sci-fi game. About memories. Called <i>Remember Me<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The Ghost in the Shell series was a very dire and realistic meditation on the nature of technological progress and its influence on politics, the planet, and the self. It&#8217;s a crime drama first, but the themes of memories and identity run throughout all of the proceedings.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Remember Me opens like, &#8220;You lost your memories! Because a company called Memorize decided they could do whatever they wanted with your memories! Now take &#8217;em down, so we can all have our memories back! Even if you have to mess with other people&#8217;s memories! And remember to remember to memorize memories!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now, isn&#8217;t it kind of obvious that the big twist is gonna come when you get your memories back? I know it&#8217;s a sci-fi, but it feels really silly and regressive to just make your plot <i>actually involve<\/i> what your game is thematically addressing.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m getting stuck on this, but&#8230; You&#8217;re supposed to use the plot to convey the point, the same way you use a frying pan to cook a steak. You can&#8217;t take the meaning of the game and then build the plot on that. You can&#8217;t cook a steak with another steak.<\/p>\n<p>To be fair, there is other stuff going on in the game: the haves vs. the have-nots. The rich can afford to relive their own happy memories, while the impoverished can only scrape together the memories of others and go nuts in the process. There&#8217;s even a character early on whose decision to do something drastic is based on a very expensive hospital bill she has to pay. It actually feels just barely relevant at times.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just plot and aesthetics you use to convey meaning: it&#8217;s mechanics. The script seems to be telling us that the game is about the malleability of the human psyche, and that my character is a genius hacker. If that&#8217;s so, how come I spend less time rewriting people&#8217;s memories &#8211; which is, in fact, a very neat and juicy bit of the game &#8211; and more time punching junkies and climbing up and down the sides of walls?<\/p>\n<p>The thing is, Remember Me isn&#8217;t the first game that&#8217;s about running toward a glowing waypoint or climbing and punching things like a drunk amnesiac baboon. But it&#8217;s the last one I deign to play.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why is parkour still a thing in video games now?
