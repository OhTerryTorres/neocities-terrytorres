Shigesato Itoi, the creator, clearly did not want to have to disrupt the dramatic flow of Buzz Buzz&#8217;s death by making the player go through their inventory and throw something away, so he just rewards the player&#8217;s ingenuity by suddenly making up more stuff that Buzz Buzz can do.<\/p>\n<p>I love this script.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So here&#8217;s the first real trick you can pull in Earthbound.
