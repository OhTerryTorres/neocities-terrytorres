I&#8217;d believe it!<\/p>\n<p>Despite this, it&#8217;s likely that Dad will be the single character in the game you talk to the most, as he saves your game. Like many good fathers, his duties are vague and unknowable to a young mind, but incredibly important.<\/p>\n<p>Every time you call Dad to save your game, he asks if you&#8217;re ready to stop playing and hit the hay.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t take him up on the offer, he says,<\/p>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ness, you like to work hard, just like your mother. But, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good to work too hard.<br \/>(Click! Beep-beep-beep&#8230;)<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><\/b><br \/>Ness&#8217; dad telling me not to work too hard is basically the reason the rest of my school career turned out the way it did. If you say Yes to his suggestion, he says,<\/p>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re a great team, aren&#8217;t we? Well, you should turn the power OFF instead of just pressing RESET. All right?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><\/b><br \/>And then the game just stops. The background music continues, but you can&#8217;t close the dialog box, you can&#8217;t move, pause, or do anything. All you can do is turn the game off, like you told Dad you would.<\/p>\n<p>I never realized it until this current playthrough, but in turning off the game, <i>you are hanging up the phone.<\/i> That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s no Click! Beep-beep-beep at the end of that sentence!<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of whispering &#8220;Good night&#8221; when turning the game off.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/i129.photobucket.com\/albums\/p214\/kefkajr\/Earthbound_00034.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another funny thing Dad does is, once you have the Receiver phone from <a href=\"http:\/\/terryplays.blogspot.com\/2012\/07\/trolling-in-twoson.html\">Apple Kid<\/a>, he will call you if he thinks you&#8217;ve been playing too long. After a long period of time without saving, even if you&#8217;re in the middle of a dungeon, Dad will call and ask if you think you&#8217;ve played long enough.<\/p>\n<p>Mostly, it&#8217;s just a reminder. He won&#8217;t save your game in the middle of nowhere, but he does tell you to get somewhere safe and get some rest.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s REALLY funny is if you play for a long time in one sitting, and then Dad calls while you&#8217;re playing as <a href=\"http:\/\/terryplays.blogspot.com\/2012\/07\/jeffs-family.html\">Jeff<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello, it&#8217;s your dad.
