<p>
	If Yuichiro Tanaka and Katsura Hashino ever had the fuel to write a good story, they have burnt straight through it.
</p>
<p>
	One of the last things Hulkenberg says is, "The people cannot rightly trust a king whose face they do not know."
</p>
<p>
	I want to remind Hulkenberg of something everybody already knows: the king's face, 
	because of the events of the game, has become one of the most known faces in the entire world. 
	Either Hulkenberg or the scriptwriters forgot that this world of magic has conjured up, in the center of a every town square 
	throughout the land, a <em>giant stone face</em> that reflects the king's appearance exactly and has 
	increased in size with his fame. It is the one face the average person would know best aside from their friends and family.
</p>
<p>
	This may be Potent Political Commentary on a lazy electorate who, even with magic at their disposal, refused to participate 
	in their civic duty. A ton of people may just never look at the king's giant stone face at all. "Unless the king brings down 
	the price of gasoline, I don't give a shit."
</p>
<p>
	Also, let me get this straight about Pontifex Forden's big plan. He tried to kill the Prince by burning the Elda village, but I guess the 
	Prince got away somehow to live at the palace. So then years later, he wants to kill the Prince using a child prodigy (Rella) so that 
	he could give a demotion to another child prodigy (Louis). I feel like this could be Potent Commentary on organized religion's obsession 
	with controlling children, but it strains credulity that Forden's whole career depends on managing no less than three very special 
	unreleated children simultaneously. And he can't just have Louis killed as well, because, I don't know there would be an uprising amongst 
	the armed forced if a particularly charismatic 14 year old died? How the hell old is Louis supposed to be, exactly?
</p>
<p>
	Anyway Rella gets stagefright and decides to improvise a coma curse on the Prince instead of killing him. Forden then, somehow (again!), loses track 
	of the Prince's body and it ends up back in the Eldan village he was so sure he had destroyed. I'd also like to point out that Forden 
	also failed to verify Louis' death after the party attempts to assassinate <i>him</i>. Just to highlight how much of the plot happens 
	based on Forden failing to verify that these extremely powerful magical people who absolutely need to be dead for his plans to work are 
	<i>actually dead</i>.
</p>
<p>
	So Forden fails to 1) kill the Prince, 2) disenfranchise Louis, or 3) indoctrinate or intimidate Rella. This is the ruthless Sanctist Church 
	we'resupposed to be so afraid of.
</p>
<p>
	This game is pretty misogynistic. You don't just have to have female characters dress in gratuitously sexy clothes to be misogynistic. You can 
	also just treat them as children or objects lacking agency. (See: <a href="https://terrytorres.neocities.org/plays/posts/2017_06_16_lame-shit-in-persona-5-that-could-have-been-fixed">Ann</a>)
</p>
<p>
	If Lady Joanna were a man, the cast would call him a disgusting freak for <em>murdering so many children</em>. Instead, she's just a smol bean 
	because, I mean, who could blame her? I know if I were a mother and I lost my child, my life would be over and I would 
	obviously go <i>nutso crazy</i> and could not be held accountable for my actions. At worst, I would accept my execution nobly with my 
	head held high. Hey, when it comes to a ruler mudering a pile of children, we're all victims, really.
</p>
<p>
	Heismay, being a man, can shoulder the tragedy of a child's death. Heismay's arc is quite unique for a video game. When did you last spend 
	so much time helping a parent decide what to do with his child's remains? 
	As for Heismay's child's mother? Well. Uh... who cares. In fact, let's not even allude to her existence a single time. Surely that 
	isn't incredbly weird at all. She probably wasn't even cool!
</p>
<p>
	Now, Rella, who cursed the Prince to save her sister's life? She's gotta die. "I mean, she's super talented, can't she just undo the curse?" 
	No, sorry, that's not the rules of the curse. "Seriously, she's so powerful she can use telepathy on a bunch of people across a great distance. 
	The Prince has already been comatose for a long time, we can wait a little longer for her to figure it out." Sorry, no, 
	if we keep her alive, we'll have to explain why she can't join your party. It's way, way eaier to just kill her, trust me.
</p>
<p>
	Speaking of magic, magic is bullshit. For random NPCs, it means telepathy and turning people into monsters. For you, it's only 
	ever elemental attacks and buffs. And you never even use those in cutscenes. Gameplay over on this side, please, plot on that side, thank you. 
</p>
<p>
	The King's Magic keeps the top contenders for the crown from being assassinated. The ONLY way you can strike someone whose face is on the 
	big rock is by challenging them to a duel. Okay. So how come, in the back half of the game, every single monster doesn't explode when they 
	come near you? I sure as shit didn't consent to being attacked by monsters. If I walk around with my weapon out, does that automatically 
	consent to every duel? Is that how it works?
</p>
<p>
	The King's Magic is absolute. Unless you yell at the sky for it to go away, like Louis does. Well, to be fair, he probably had to do that so 
	the script writers would be able to ignore the rules of the middle of the story so they can write a classic final RPG act where you just 
	fight your way to the top. Thanks, Louis!
</p>
<p>
	It's funny how, despite the possibilities setup by Metaphor's world, the writers always do their best to steer the game back toward what 
	they know instead of trying something knew. They come up with the concept of a dead king deciding his successor based on the popular will. 
	How does one achieve popularity? Well, dungeon crawling like you did in Persona 5. Boy, that's convenient. It's almost like the story could 
	have been about anything and the gameplay would be the same no matter what.
</p>
<p>
	Yes, I know you can "debate" your opponents. It's not an in-depth system or anything. The game can't end with batgirl mechanic Lina Kayden 
	as king. You can't even get too popular too quickly, and the game will lock your popularity ranking until the plot decides your popularity 
	for you. The popularity mechanic mostly feels like playing pretend with the game, because we both know that I can't change the script by 
	debating or dungeoning-crawling differently. And the game itself acknowledges that the will of the people is nowhere near as rewarding as 
	getting on good terms with about 14 very specific people.
</p>
<p>
	Isn't it weird that the Sanctist Church co-opts the Dead King's Magic Contest to create a fake tournament of their own? Wouldn't it be to 
	the church's benefit to ignore the contest and continue their largely unopposed reign, rather than allowing a public event to be coopted 
	by someone they can't control? Wouldn't it be to your party's benefit to avoid participating in events controlled by the powerful 
	institution that hates you? Why do any of them do this? Oh? So that there's a reason for an important plot point to occur exactly every 30 
	days, just like in Persona 5? Gotcha.
</p>
<p>
	Remember how the Prince's curse is cured and we know about it right away, and we don't immediately go to him in our airship and let 
	everyone know he's alive and instantly get everyone on our side? Why? Are we stupid? Does the script just need to to dick around for a 
	week so the Prince can get "killed off" while defending someone? The Prince's soul-less body got up and, what, took a sword stab for some 
	peasant? And the people charged with protecting him for years let him endanger himself, <i>the exact thing they've been trying to avoid 
	for years?</i> 
</p>
<p>
	Isn't it weird that the prospective ruler of the kingdom almost never talks except to 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhrlM3nYzFg">sound like a doofus</a> or 
	<a href="https://terrytorres.neocities.org/images/metaphor1.jpg">act</a> as a 
	<a href="https://terrytorres.neocities.org/images/metaphor2.jpg">thesaurus</a> but 
	<a href="https://terrytorres.neocities.org/images/metaphor3.jpg">only for the word Yes</a>? Shouldn't a leader have a strong voice of their own, as demonstrated by 
	the other frontrunners like Forden, Louis, and the old king himself? Oh? Because the protagonist is silent in Persona 5? Gotcha.
</p>
<p>
	Mass Effect came out in 2007 and is still a prefect simulator for being a leader, making hard choices, and influencing people. Metaphor, 
	just like Persona 5 before it, is a Special Little Boy simulator. You're not the main character because you've done anything. Somebody 
	else decided you're a Special Little Boy, and that's why everything's gonna work out for you. If anything goes wrong, don't worry: you'll 
	never have to change or sacrifice anything. In fact, it turns out you're a Super Special Little Boy, so those bad things won't happen, 
	and everybody will be nice to you, because they have to.
</p>
<p>
	Metaphor is a political game in the sense that I am Spider-Man for Halloween. I put on the costume and then I take it off when I'm done. 
	I might say stuff Spider-Man would say, but I can't help you fight Doctor Octopus. Metaphor evokes racism and the institutional power of 
	the church, but then it goes off and does whatever it planned on doing anyway and tells a story that might be challenging if you stopped 
	reading books when teachers didn't make you anymore. The cute kid whose dad dies keeps a stiff upper lip and cheers everyone up. 
	If someone in a pair of siblings has to die, it'll be the colder and more stuckup one, not the friendly one. The divine rite of kings is 
	bad: unless it applies to you, then it's good and should be upheld. The land just needs a really, really Special Little Boy as King. The 
	scam artist is secretly super noble and loves his mom and sacrifices himself to help you except just kidding he just faked his death!
	No bummers allowed here!!
</p>
<p>
	Final Fantasy Tactics is a game where the first encounter has you failing to protect the princess. The second encounter makes you murder 
	peasants in a wage dispute. If you're gonna tell me a game is political and it doesn't acknowledge how difficult it is to balance a society's 
	material conditions without sacrifice - and it never puts you in a position where you feel that sacrifice - keep it to yourself.
</p>
<p>
	Your mom uses the last of her magic (which, again, does whatever a NPC wants it to do) to save her soul and become a living voiceover 
	instead of her subjects being burned alive. What an asshole. And this lady is supposed to lead me down the path to being a virtuous ruler?
	Well, she certainly knows what a bad ruler looks like: she is one and she also had a child with one. I would be so pissed if the child of 
	these jerks ended up in charge of my kingdom.
</p>
<p>
	The plot hinges on a Party City accessory. Louis keeps a headband with fake clemar horns on 100% of the time for his entire career. 
	This only works because the character designs for Metaphor are incredibly lame. Clemars don't have cro magnon brows or fangs. They just 
	look like regular humans with little horns. Paripus don't have pointed faces and claws, just little ears and a tail. The rhoag are just dudes 
	with tattoos. The winged characters can't fly.
</p>
<p>
	The nidia look like fucking <em>Muppet Babies</em>. But only for the two specific times where one specific nidia lets the magical glamour 
	that makes them look tall and slender lapses. All other Nidia are constantly keeping up a magical spell to make them look like everbody else. What the fuck?
</p>
<p>
	All of this makes the prejudice against the elda so flimsy. The average person has never seen an elda. Do they even know what one looks like? 
	I thought elda had heterochromia, but apparently that's just a Main Character trait. So a random person sees the Main Character's fucked up 
	eyes and somehow don't think he's a nidia (who, in addition to being Muppet Babies, have crazy prismatic irises). They don't think he's a 
	rhoag with very faint tattoos. They don't think he has clemar horns hidden under his dumb headband. They jump straight to the wildest 
	conclusion, that this person must be from the tribe nobody has seen for years.
</p>
<p>
	Even after they've given themselves license to do something out-there and weird by designing, I don't know, fantastical characters for this 
	fantasy world, the designers have some kind of disease where everyone has be made tall, slender, and covered in Louis Vuitton patterns. The 
	only difference from Persona is that the outfits in Metaphor would have you briefly detained by the police.
</p>
<p>
	This game where everyone constantly tells you exactly how they feel all of the time without any obfuscation or rhetorical tricks is called 
	"Metaphor." Fantasy <i>is</i> dead.
