					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget Kain from Final Fantasy IV. While at a glance one may want to assume Kain&#039;s betrayal was merely because Golbez and/or Zemus manipulated him with magic, if you think about it, Kain was probably only susceptible because of his own nature. Kain was always jealous of Cecil&#039;s relationship with Rosa, and resented the fact that the King of Baron favored dark knights over dragoons. Kain also seemed much more willing than Cecil to kill Rydia after the events at Mist. If just anybody could be enchanted, why didn&#039;t Golbez and/or Zemus try to mind control Rosa during her extended imprisonment in the Tower of Zot? The answer is that Kain always had a treacherous streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a (in my opinion) lesser extent, the tension between Frog and Magus in Chrono Trigger is similarly interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some cultural and historical reasons for the Japanese tendency towards having protagonists getting along with each other more quickly and seamlessly than what Western sensibilities would find &#034;realistic,&#034; but it would hijack the page to get into all of that here. However, JRPGs do tend to have rather humanized and likeable antagonists, some of whom even sympathize with the protagonists, and who once in a while even join the party late in the game, or experience an epiphany in defeat and express their regrets and apologies before dying. While perhaps not as conspicuous as the &#034;douchebag Nash&#034; phenomenon, I do find the JRPG treatment of villains this way to be nuanced and compelling.]]></description>
